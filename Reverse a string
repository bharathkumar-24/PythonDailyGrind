Q. Write a function to reverse a string.
Constraints
•	The input variable string must be of type str.
•	There are no specific constraints on the length or content of the string.

Test Case #1
Input: "G3n3r@tiv3AI"
Output: "IA3v1t@r3n3G"
Description: This test case examines the function’s capacity to handle a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters 
without altering their order other than reversing the string.

Test Case #2
Input: "Le3tsWriT#S0meTestCases!"
Output: "!sesaCtseT0Sem#TirWsTe3L"
Description: This case tests the function with a longer string composed of varied characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and 
special characters, to ensure the reversal is accurately managed.

Test Case #3
Input: "Palindrome123454321emordnilaP"
Output: "Pladnirome123454321emordnilaP"
Description: The function is tested on a palindrome string combined with numbers to verify that the reversal properly maintains the integrity of the 
mirrored characters in the original sequence.

SOLUTION:

def ReverseString(s):
    return s[::-1]

s="G3n3r@tiv3AI"
print(ReverseString(s))
