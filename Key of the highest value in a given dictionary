Find the key of the highest value in a given dictionary. If there is more than one record with the highest value, sort their keys in ascending order
and return the first.

Constraints
â€¢	The input variable dct must be a dictionary.

Test Case #1
Input: {"date": 3, "apple": 5, "banana": 2, "cherry": 5}
Output: "apple"
Description: This case tests the function"s ability to handle multiple keys with the same highest value and return the key that comes first in lexicographical order.

Test Case #2
Input: {"car": 10, "bike": 15, "truck": 20, "scooter": 20}
Output: "scooter"
Description: This case examines the function"s behavior with the maximum values and ensures it picks the correct lexicographically smallest key among the highest values.

Test Case #3
Input: c
Output: "a"
Description: This case challenges the function to handle ties among multiple highest values and determine the smallest key in ascending order.

SOLUTION:

def HighestValue(my_dict):
    my_dict=dict(sorted(my_dict.items(),key=lambda x : x[1],reverse=True))
    return list(my_dict.keys())[0]
    
my_dict={"a": 2, "b": 2, "x": 1, "y": 1, "z": 2}
print(HighestValue(my_dict))
