Q2. Find common words in any given two sentences and return them sorted alphabetically.
Constraints
•	The input variables sentence1 and sentence2 must be of type str.
•	The input sentences should not be empty.
•	The sentences can contain any characters, including letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and whitespace.
•	The sentences can be of any length, from empty strings to very long sentences.
•	The sentences are case-insensitive, meaning that the comparison of words should be done in a case-insensitive manner.
•	The sentences can contain duplicate words, but the output set should only contain unique common words.

Test Case #1
Input: ["Today is a great day to learn something new!", "Is today the day to learn?"]
Output: ["day", "is", "learn", "to", "today"]
Description: This test checks if the function can correctly identify common words regardless of their position in the sentence and handle a simple punctuation mark.

Test Case #2
Input: ["Learning to code: it's fun and engaging", "Engaging activities include learning to code."]
Output: ["code", "engaging", "learning", "to"]
Description: This test evaluates the function's ability to match words that are identical despite the presence of punctuation and possessive forms nearby.

Test Case #3
Input: ["The cat's favorite toy", "The favorite toy of the cat is here."]
Output: ["favorite", "the", "toy"]
Description: This test verifies if the function can correctly identify common words, including those preceded by possessive markers.

SOLUTION:

import re
def CommonWords(lst):
    sentence1=re.sub(r'[^A-Za-z0-9 ]+', '',lst[0].lower())
    sentence2=re.sub(r'[^A-Za-z0-9 ]+', '',lst[1].lower())
    result=[]
    for i in sentence1.split():
        for j in sentence2.split():
            if i==j:
                result.append(j)
    return sorted(set(result))

lst=["Learning to code: it's fun and engaging", "Engaging activities include learning to code."]
print(CommonWords(lst))
