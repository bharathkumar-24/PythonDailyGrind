You are given two positive integers n and k.

An integer x is called k-palindromic if:

x is a palindrome.
x is divisible by k.
An integer is called good if its digits can be rearranged to form a k-palindromic integer. For example, for k = 2, 2020 can be rearranged to form the k-palindromic integer 2002, whereas 1010 cannot be rearranged to form a k-palindromic integer.

Return the count of good integers containing n digits.

Note that any integer must not have leading zeros, neither before nor after rearrangement. For example, 1010 cannot be rearranged to form 101.

 SOLUTION:

def fun(n,k):
    count=0
    for i in range((10)**(n-1),(10)**n):
        s=str(i)
        rev=s[::-1]
        if s==rev and int(s)%k==0 :
            count+=1
    return count  
        
n = 3
k = 5
fun(n,k)
