Q. You are given a positive integer n and an integer k. You need to rotate the digits of the number n by k places to the right. For example, 
if n = 12345 and k = 2, the result after rotating the digits to the right by 2 places would be 45123.

def RotateElements(n,k):
    s=str(n)
    result=s[-k::]+s[:-k]
    return result
