Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and leave the other as original.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"

SOLUTION:

def reverseStr(s, k):
    l=0
    result=''
    while l<len(s):
        r=l+k
        x=s[l:r]
        result+=x[::-1]
        l+=2*k
        result+=s[r:l]
    return result 
s= "abcd"
k=2
#"bacdfeg"
print(reverseStr(s,k))
