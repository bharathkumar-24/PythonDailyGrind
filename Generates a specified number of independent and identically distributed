Q.Write a function that generates a specified number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) draws from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.
The function should take the number of draws as an argument and return a list of random numbers.
Note: Use a fixed random seed of 42 to ensure that the results are reproducible.

Test Case #1
Input: 5
Output: "[0.37, 0.95, 0.73, 0.6, 0.16]"
Description: This test case assesses the function"s correctness in generating a small number of i.i.d. draws from the uniform distribution between 0 and 1.

Test Case #2
Input: 100
Output: "A list of 100 random numbers between 0 and 1, e.g., [0.134, 0.245, 0.756, ..., 0.890]. "
Description: This test validates the function"s ability to handle a larger number of i.i.d. draws, ensuring the output remains within the expected range and 
maintains the properties of the distribution.

Test Case #3
Input: 0
Output: "An empty list, []."
Description: This case challenges the function"s handling of the edge case where no draws are requested, ensuring it returns an empty list appropriately.

SOLUTION:

import random
def RandomNumber(n):
    lst=[round(random.random(),2) for i in range(n)]
    return lst

n=12
print(RandomNumber(n))
